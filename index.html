                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Hasan Ibn Al Haytham was a Muslim Arab mathematician, astronomer, and physicist of the Islamic Golden Age. Referred to as "the father of modern optics”, he made significant contributions to the principles of optics and visual perception
                    in particular. His most influential work is titled <q><cite>Kitāb al-Manāẓir</cite></q>, which survived in a Latin edition. he also wrote on philosophy, theology and medicine.

                <p>
                    Ibn Al Haytham was the first to explain that vision occurs when light reflects from an object and then passes to one's eyes. He was also the first to demonstrate that vision occurs in the brain, rather than in the eyes. Building upon a naturalistic, empirical
                    method pioneered by Aristotle in ancient Greece, Ibn Al Haytham was an early proponent of the concept that a hypothesis must be supported by experiments based on confirmable procedures or mathematical evidenc an early pioneer in the
                    scientific method five centuries before Renaissance scientists.

                <h3>Here's a Summary of Ibn Al Haytham's life</h3>

                    <li>He Studied mathematics and science in his young age.</li>
                    <li>He held a position with the title vizier in his native Basra</li>
                    <li>He lived most of his life in Cairo Egypt</li>

                    <li> <strong>1038</strong> he traveled to Andalusia, where he had plenty of time for his scientific endeavors, which included optics, mathematics, physics and medicine, and to do some scientific experiments; He wrote many books on those
                        subjects.
                    </li>
                    <li>His research in optics focused on the study of optical systems using mirrors, especially on spherical and concave mirrors and spherical aberration.</li>
                    <li>He also proved that the ratio between the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction is not equal. He also presented a number of studies on the magnification forces of lenses</li>
                    <li> <strong>1040</strong> He died in Cairo City</li>
                </ul>

            <blockquote>
                <p>“After the death of Archimedes no really great physicist appeared until Ibn al-Haytham. If, therefore, we confine our interest only to the history of physics, there is a long period of over twelve hundred years during which the Golden
                    Age of Greece gave way to the era of Muslim Scholasticism, and the experimental spirit of the noblest physicist of Antiquity lived again in the Arab Scholar from Basra. ”</p>
